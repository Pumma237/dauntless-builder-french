## Data documentation

New version coming soon... In the meantime you can check out the old Documentation [here](https://github.com/atomicptr/dauntless-builder/tree/dauntless-builder/v1#using-the-dauntless-builder-build-id-format). It's basically the same, the only difference are the variables within it [(check this, to see which variables we're actually using](https://github.com/atomicptr/dauntless-builder/blob/master/src/models/BuildModel.jsx#L8)) and the map has a slightly different structure/path ([click here](https://github.com/atomicptr/dauntless-builder/blob/master/.map/names.json)).

You can access the data via the following URLs:

* https://www.dauntless-builder.com/data.json - The data
* https://www.dauntless-builder.com/meta.json - Meta data, with a hash (to check if the data has changed), a timestamp etc.
* https://www.dauntless-builder.com/map/names.json - The ID to Name map

## Assets
